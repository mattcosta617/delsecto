<h1>DELSECTO!</h1>


<h2>Walk Through</h2>

  <p>  
Delsecto is an website that allows Users to debug and help others debug. It is built for General Assembly 
students to help with learning as a community. To start on the site you'll be brought to the home page where a User can see all the options of choosing a language, a question, asking a question, or signing up and logging in. First things first, the user should log in. After login, all questions and solutions the user posts will be stored in their personal profile.

The User may ask a question which will then be posted on to the questions page and will allow users the ability to help them seek and answer. In turn, they may also post answers to other students questions and help ease other students with their learning curves. Each question posted comes with a language Id which will also allow you to look up questions by language on the language page. 

The User also has the ability to Update or delete questions if any errors were made in the posting process.

<h2>Down The Line Goals</h2>

<p>
Further down the line we would like Users to be able to comment on each question and allow for a forum to take place. This would allow for clearer discussions on topics. Along with that we'd like for users to have the ability to display their online status so that Users can chat with one another actively and work together. Giving all users the ability to like and dislike solutions would allow for us to post the most popular answers to questions.

<h2>Highlights to creating this website</h2>

<p>
A few highlights from creating this website were having the questions post to the proper language.
